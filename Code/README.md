# WebXR Mars Development Folder

This folder contains the development files of the Mars WebXR project.
The project is built with `npm run build`, then locally hosted with `npm run start`.

The `src` folder contains the typescript files which are used to create the project.
The `public` folder is the file which typescript uses to host the built project.
The `dist` folder contains the final built project for each build, the contents of which are then placed in the `docs` folder within this projects root.

Files within `./docs` are hosted at https://koildoch.github.io/WebXR-Mars-Simulation/

What is WebXR?
  API designed to access sensors and display of immersive hardware (VR, AR and Mixed Reality).
  
WebXR identifies what the user is looking at then rendering in WebGL (any other rendering library is compatible but for this project I have chosen OpenGL).
WebXR aims to support existing devices but also paving a way for future devices.

For the project the focus will be on Virtual Reality with an Oculus Rift as the main device which WebXR will access for sensors. (I also have access to a HTC Vive which could
be interesting for compatability testing.)

An alternate path is the use of smartphones for virtual reality. Devices exist where a user could place their phone inside the headset, this is a popular alternative due to the 
demand for powerful hardware that traditional virtual reality headsets required.
